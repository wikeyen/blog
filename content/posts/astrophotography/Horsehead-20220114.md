[The Horsehead Nebula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horsehead_Nebula) (also known as Barnard 33) is a small dark nebula in the constellation Orion. The nebula is located just to the south of Alnitak, the easternmost star of Orion's Belt, and is part of the much larger Orion Molecular Cloud Complex. It appears within the southern region of the dense dust cloud known as Lynds 1630, along the edge of the much larger, active star-forming H II region called IC 434.

The Horsehead Nebula is approximately 422 parsecs or 1,375 light-years from Earth. It is one of the most identifiable nebulae because of its resemblance to a horse's head.



马头星云位于猎户座，也称为巴纳德33（Barnard 33），在发射星云IC 434之内，是一个暗星云。这个星云就在猎户腰带最东边的参宿一南方，并且是非常巨大的猎户座分子云团的一部分。马头星云距离地球大约1,500光年，是最容易识别的星云之一，因为从地球看过去，黑暗的尘埃和旋转的气体构成的形状有如马头。这个星云的形状在1888年第一次被注意到，哈佛大学天文台的威廉敏娜·弗莱明在拍摄的B2312号干版中发现了这个暗星云。.

增长的红光主要来自星云后面的氢气，它们是被邻近的亮星猎户座σ电离产生的。黑暗的马头星云主要是由浓厚的尘埃造成，而马头的颈部下方在左边造成了阴影。离开星云的气体因为强大的磁场而形成漏斗状，马头星云基部的亮点都是正在形成过程的年轻恒星。

This one was taken during my trip to Yunnan. Due to the limited access to an open and safe area to place my devices in the hotel and a very short period before the nebula went behind the houses in front of my room. Eventually, I managed to photograph in the hallway for the Ha channel. The fine details revealed by a photo with 5 minutes exposure time were mind-blowing; I didn't even need to calibrate with flat/dark/dark flat/bias frames; some very light processes were applied to make it colourful by the Lightroom app on my iPhone.



一月份去云南旅游的时候所拍。由于所住的酒店并没有特别安全开旷的场所，且到星云被前方房屋挡住之前只有很短一段窗口期；最终才勉勉强强在楼道里拍摄了 Ha 通道的马头星云。单张五分钟，细节已经非常震撼！甚至没有用到平场、暗场、暗平场、Bias 来做纠正，手机 Lightroom 稍微拉了一下颜色直接出图.
